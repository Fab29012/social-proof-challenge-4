## My process
This took a very long time, i had to really think about how everything was ligned up and then I realized it was actually not a difficult task, played around with margin and boom ! However I still encountered difficulties making sure everything was ligned up perfectly. For the background, I went back to an old project and found the solution. 

### What I learned
How to position content on top of a background image. 
.bottomcontainer {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%; 
    left: 50%; 
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
This is what allowed me to do so. 

### Continued development
Setting @media quaries is still very difficult for me and I was unable to do so.
